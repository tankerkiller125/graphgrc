# SCF - TDA-09 - Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Testing Throughout Development
Mechanisms exist to require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to: 
(1) Create and implement a Security Testing and Evaluation (ST&E) plan, or similar capability;
(2) Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
(3) Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes.

## Control questions
Does the organization require system developers/integrators consult with cybersecurity & data privacy personnel to: 
 (1) Create and implement a Security Testing and Evaluation (ST&E) plan, or similar capability;
 (2) Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process to correct weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security testing and evaluation process; and
 (3) Document the results of the security testing/evaluation and flaw remediation processes?
