# SCF - AST-04 - Network Diagrams & Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
Mechanisms exist to maintain network architecture diagrams that: 
(1) Contain sufficient detail to assess the security of the network's architecture;
(2) Reflect the current architecture of the network environment; and
(3) Document all sensitive/regulated data flows.

## Control questions
Does the organization maintain network architecture diagrams that: 
 (1) Contain sufficient detail to assess the security of the network's architecture;
 (2) Reflect the current architecture of the network environment; and
 (3) Document all sensitive/regulated data flows?
