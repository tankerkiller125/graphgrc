# SCF - MON-03 - Content of Event Logs
Mechanisms exist to configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum:
(1) Establish what type of event occurred;
(2) When (date and time) the event occurred;
(3) Where the event occurred;
(4) The source of the event;
(5) The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and 
(6) The identity of any user/subject associated with the event.

## Control questions
Does the organization configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum:
 (1) Establish what type of event occurred;
 (2) When (date and time) the event occurred;
 (3) Where the event occurred;
 (4) The source of the event;
 (5) The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and 
 (6) The identity of any user/subject associated with the event?
